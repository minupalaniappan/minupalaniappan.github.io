				<p class = "body-text">Born and raised in the Bay Area, I had the opportunity to see how technology augmented the world around me. And being raised by an engineer and entrepreneur, forwarding and widenening the technology landscape seemed like a daily conversation in the household. But my love for building software never quite came into it's own until the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Apple's groundbreaking mobile device not only introduced an unparalleled form of mobile computing, but would also empower creators to build at scale. Seeing Electronic Arts introduce immersive racing games that leveraged the in-built gyroscope for steering and multi-touch for game immersion pushed me to dream about apps I had wanted to see in the world. With an international audience, independent developers could now produce applications that would go on to serve millions of iOS customers. Since publishing my first iOS app in 2008, my desire to identify problems and address them through the development of consumer technology has been steadfast.</p>
