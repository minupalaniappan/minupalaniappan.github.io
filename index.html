			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h3>I'm just a kid trying to make cool stuff.</h3>
			<h4>I'm Minu Palaniappan. I was born in the Bay Area and am currently 18 years old. I enjoy building ideas primarily on the web and have been building awesome ideas since I was 14. I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis.</h4>
			<h4>I've spent primarily most of my time in building full-stack websites with the rapid templating language, Django. I've also experimented with the iOS and Android platforms, releasing a few apps to their respective app stores. In the future, I hope to pursue mobile technologies to expand my versatility. </h4>
			<h4>I'm not all work though. In my free time, I enjoy to binge-watch episodes on Netflix, play casual pick-up basketball, catch-up on my Twitter and Instagram.</h4>
