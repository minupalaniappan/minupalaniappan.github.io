          <p class = "text">Born and raised in the Bay Area, I had the fortune of being surrounded by technology at an early age. Supported by a software engineer and serial entrepreneur, I was always taught to value my curiosity and drop any aversion to risk. But only in 2007, did I find utility for software development to be incredibly powerful. That year, Apple introduced the original iPhone; not only did it's introduction open the floodgates to an era of unparalleled mobile computing, but also enabled the creation of 1-man companies. In 07', I launched my first application on the Apple App Store; more than a decade later, I still use my curiosity to guide me through the development of new and exciting platforms.</p>

Using big data service Apache Spark & in house data mining tools, the platform offers any customer the ability to learn about a company or individual within a matter of minutes. I worked on integrating IBM's Watson API into the core service; this integration added a machine-learning layer to lead generation. This was my first and only remote internship; the largest benefit to this experience was learning how to balance a full academic course load and an engineering internship.</p>

I began my work at CK-12 in the summer of 2008, and would return to the organization every summer till I graduated high school in 2014. In my time there, I developed an internal tool that streamlined the content citation process, an android application that gamified a large portion of their testing material, flash applications that demonstrated STEM concepts. I credit my experience at CK-12 for enabling me to build persistence, natural curiosity and professionalism.</p>
