### 2014

2014 was a good year. I had just graduated from high school and wanted to get into some web dev. So it made sense to first build a personal website. CSS was really straightforward, but plugging in the JS that would power the animations and scrolling was a bit tough.

Here was the [2014](http://www.minupalaniappan.com/2014) version I had built.

### 2015

This website was inspired by all the bland & gray sites that only valued beautiful typefaces. This build included Foundation.css and the Proxima Nova Font Face (btw, its a great font!). I added some custom CSS to make the tabs look a little better. Other than that, it was designed kind of like a broken up resume and read very well.

### 2016

I'm trying something different this year. I wanted to experiment with Jekyll and static blogware. So, whatever your seeing now is the 2016 production version.
