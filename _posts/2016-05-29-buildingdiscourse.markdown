I've failed many times at making projects grow, but I think I have finally found my first project with true organic growth. UC Discourse caters to college students, and I just so happen to be in college myself.

### The Inception
It was the beggining of summer and I had just completed my first year of college. Dojo had become an afterthought due to the uphill climb we knew social was going to be. I wasn't ashamed of giving up on the project; I felt proud to open source great technology which happened to be embraced by the Hacker community.

But what was I to do know? I felt liberated but at the sametime lost; what was I to chase?

Luckily, I got a call from my friend Andy. He was a savy developer with a genuine curiousity that I knew fit the founder mold; I was hoping to work with him down the road in college. To my surprise, Andy presented the opportunity to me on that call; I'm paraphrasing here, but I think he asked, "Yo, I want to work on a project related to the school. I worked on Davislib last year and I want to organize all this school data and throw it up on a website."

I thought the idea was neat, especially because a service backed by data wasn't traditionally seen in the public education system. Furthermore, the idea of providing grade distribution data to students who were typically deprived of that type of transparency would be an easy sell to the whole Davis student body. The market was there and so was the engineering talent; as a result, I agreed and was ready to get started.

### Fall quarter back from summer

We were both working fulltime over summer, so the "getting started part" never really happened. The school year then started after a full 2 month summer; unfortunately, I found myself working a job that extended past summer. This made it incredibly tough to make tangible contributions to the Discourse codebase; my contributions were limited to wireframes, designs and mockups on Sketch. On the positive side, these designs were used as references for our first version; but the idea of not writing code for Discourse made me feel incredibly empty.

This emptiness eventually boiled over and so I quit my job in hopes of working on Discourse fulltime.

The following winter quarter was fairly easy from an academic standpoint; I decided to tread light on coursework simply because I wanted to push out a live version of Discourse asap. It took a month to plugin all the Javascript, routes, HTML and Sass;
